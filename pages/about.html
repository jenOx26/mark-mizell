                Mark was born in Illinois and spent a large part of his adult life in Tennessee.  
                Mark began his legal career in 1996 in Nashville, Tennessee and spent 18 years 
                litigating matters throughout the middle Tennessee region. 
                Over the course of his 26 year legal career, he has practiced and excelled in a 
                wide range of legal areas and litigated cases in Courts ranging from Municipal Court 
                to the US Court of Appeals and everything in between.
                <br><br>In Tennessee Mark ran his own firm for some time prior to moving, but as it 
                usually happens, 9 years ago he fell in love with the Colorado lifestyle while 
                visiting and relocated to the Colorado Springs area. 
                <br><br>One of the biggest joys Mark takes from work is explaining not just what is 
                occurring in someone’s legal matter, but why.  It’s important that his client’s have 
                a thorough understanding of the law and how this affects there lives as they move 
                through the legal process. 
                <br><br>In his time away from the office Mark enjoys a wide range of activities 
                including biking, hiking, kayaking, scuba diving, skiing, and snowshoeing.
