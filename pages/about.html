                Mark grew up with a bunch of chuckleheads in Metropolis, Illinois.
                Now he's a big time lawyer in Colorado. Mark first became passionate
                about personal injury law after his friend's mother's boyfriend was mauled
                by a reckless truck driver. You can count on Mark to get back at those fuckers 
                who ruined your life. In his freetime Mark enjoys drinking, taro cards, and porn.
